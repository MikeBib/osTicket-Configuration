<h2>Installation Steps</h2>

STEP 1 – LOGGING INTO OSTICKET
<p>
Go to portal.azure.com to connect to the Virtual Machine that was created to look up the IP address and then use remote desktop to log into the VM. Then we open osTicket on the webbrowser with localhost/osTicket/. Settings icon is what shows in EXAMPLE 1A.

<p>
Since we have admin login credentials we can create users. We can also log out of the admin account and log into the agent account to see what they view on their end. This project includes creating different user access and tickets assigned. This allows me and others to see status of the ticketing system.

</p>
<p>
Additionally by going to Admin Panel>Settings>User Settings we can allow anyone to create tickets by having the item unchecked named “Require registration and login to create tickets”. 
To add users (non-IT employees) go to the “Agent Panel” by selecting the icon on the top right of the screen. Here we can enter employees into the system.
